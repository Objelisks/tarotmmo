Layers:
used for:
  exit zones
  plant distributions
  collision
  ground + heightmap
needs:
  density map
  link to generator/callback
  saving all that
layer syntax:
  let collision = new Layer({region}).does(collides).does(navmap);
  let ground = new Layer({region}).does(generator(terrain)));
  let flowers = new Layer({region}).does(generator(plant(flower)));
  let exitlayers = exits.map(e => new Layer({region: e.region}).does(exit(e.meta)));


place set pieces that procedurally change themselfs to fit context + params
have to find the wandering folx to train with them for magic abilities

Networking:
socket.io
skip peer to peer for now, can be added on as an optimization,
functionally, the game should be able to work the same.
server will route packets to the correct players
will need signalling anyways
anyways: no simulation on the server
this allows clients to 'cheat' and say they're anywhere
only problem is when modifications are made to the world
the server needs to see that and persist the changes

Patterns: 
set pieces can project forces and variables
of set pieces have a set of linear coefficients that 
combine forces from everything else, default to no 
interaction, layers of vector fields, layers can 
topologically depend on previous layers to multiply 
forces, use gradients of specific layers to place set 
pieces, derivatives provide normal and position, 
constant layers provide flags for toggling styles, 
antipatterns to apply negative force weights to 
turn off automatic placement of set pieces


terrain:
set pieces + moldable terrain
2d base terrain, but bits that you can jump on top of?
maybe terrain with heightmaps and only a few (2-3) levels available.
terrain design is:
  hopping around from stump to stump
  hopping across rocks in a stream
  metroid prime hopping
  optimized fr hops
