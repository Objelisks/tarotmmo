input => move events
model(move event) => update position

place set pieces that procedurally change themselfs to fit context + params
have to find the wandering folx to train with them for magic abilities

Networking:
socket.io
skip peer to peer for now, can be added on as an optimization,
functionally, the game should be able to work the same.
server will route packets to the correct players
will need signalling anyways

Patterns: set pieces can project forces and variables
of set pieces have a set of linear coefficients that 
combine forces from everything else, default to no 
interaction, layers of vector fields, layers can 
topologically depend on previous layers to multiply 
forces, use gradients of specific layers to place set 
pieces, derivatives provide normal and position, 
constant layers provide flags for toggling styles, 
antipatterns to apply negative force weights to 
turn off automatic placement of set pieces
