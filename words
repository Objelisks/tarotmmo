Give me mMO: miniature Multiplayer Online worlds.
Intimate not dehumanizing,
Player gardens not theme parks.
Friends not strangers.

i want to make a game where the guts are exposed and you can edit the fabric
of reality by pushing blocks around, planting flowers, flames

thinking about what a fantasy rpg that isn't driven by reward scheduling
would look like
for instance, what if you center lack of action, failure, characters
who are not powerful?
rather than worshipping player agency, i think it could be tremendous to allow
a wide variety of characters with varying amounts of agency.

game spaces are often *depleted* in the course of play so the end of a game
tends to be the point at which the possibility space is totally collapsed &
the world no longer feels alive.

The new computers can predict anything, hold maps of our entire universe in
their silicon brains: past, future, origin and end. Gamblers turn to magic,
gaze into divine realms ungoverned by logic and bet on the actions of gods

Word(s) of the day: "selva oscura" - lit., a "dark/shadowed wood"; figuratively,
a period of life in which one has lost one's way, become disoriented.
From Dante's Inferno:
"Midway through the journey of life
I found myself in a dark wood,
with the clear path ahead of me lost."

An analogy: languages are like forests, not like gardens.
A forest can look chaotic and uncivilised. Unkempt, irregular, full of anarchy.
Hard to navigate. The place is full of mosquitoes! There's a hidden pond under
all that algae and also that big dead log over there just fell over. Is the
place completely out-of-control?
The garden is cultivated and neat, and shows off plant species we like for
their aesthetic properties (shape, colour, scent, maybe flavour). The upkeep
is a lot of effort, but the result is that the garden is attractive and admired.
Pleasant, and sometimes envied.
But the forest self-regulates. The local ecosystem keeps itself going. It's fine.
It's healthy. Nature is doing what it's always done. Trees fall, species feed on
other species, plants decompose, others grow. The system does not care what you
think about its appearance.
The garden is pretty to those who cultivated it, but it is artificial. Its
plants have been strongarmed into doing things that nature wasn't doing by
default. Its growth is limited by what local humans want. Plants spreading
around as usual is considered undesirable.
Languages act like forests. It is popular to create a garden (a standard
form of a language - how to speak 'well'/'correctly' in a society) and defend
it. But it is not the natural state, and maintaining it is going to be an uphill
battle that doesn't justify itself.
All active languages undergo linguistic change continuously, and there is no
evidence that any language or dialect is becoming 'dumbed down'. Linguistic
change and non-standard dialects are often regarded with contempt, but those
impressions are not backed up by science.
We like the species we select for the garden, but nature pays little to no
regard to our preferences. Those are just our own judgments about plants we
approve of. Heck, the people in the next town from us over might have a
completely different opinion of chrysanthemums.
A small garden is fine. I'm not going to deny the art of flower-arranging.
It might make sense to keep fruit trees nearby. But no one should be worrying
about the health of the forest ecosystem - or trying to turn an entire forest
into gardens supposedly for its own good.

Stolas[5] is a Great Prince of Hell, commands twenty-six legions of demons,
and teaches astronomy and the knowledge of poisonous plants, herbs and precious
stones. He is also known as Stolos, Stoppas and Solas. He is depicted as either
being a crowned owl with long legs, a raven, or a man.

if a mainstream games site is willing to cover it it's not weird enough

if it doesn't run in a web browser it might as well not exist

when the player says there is a problem they are usually right. when they tell you
what the problem is they are always wrong

the game world should go on whether anyone's playing it or not

some games are mines. some games are gardens. make gardens, not mines

most people who say the word "game" actually mean "vending machine"

take the most distinctive characteristic of the thing you just made, and make
it MORE SO. do this especially if the most distinctive characteristic is bad

you learn where the edges of a medium are by pushing in a direction until something breaks

there are three acceptable timeframes for game development: 2 hours, 2 weeks, or 2 decades

where ? does it fit ? into the player's life ???


explore the mind.
act from the heart.
take care of the body.
enjoy yourself.
do exactly what is necessary.
create your own norms.
embody change.
follow whimsical rules.
give them something to complain about.
be gentle.
and generous.

avoid terra nullius, spaces cannot be claimed / are already claimed by nature

Claris Cyarron's talk on occult in games, divination
special object, special space liminality, complex and interlocking systems all clearly on display,
abstract/vague art and symbols, thematically rich and diverse visuals, randomness,
open ended questions, no wrong answers, no mechanical impact, mix and match rules
Systems don't actually need to work or have mechanical impact, rely on human brain pattern matching


thoughts:

reading articles about how 'trust' actually erodes social interactions,
because you can't actually trust anyone at all. should be labelled 'distrust'.
if we remove all of the motivations for breaking trust, there's nothing left
but trusted interactions? this is a hypothesis.
