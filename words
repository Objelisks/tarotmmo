Give me mMO: miniature Multiplayer Online worlds.
Intimate not dehumanizing,
Player gardens not theme parks.
Friends not strangers.

i want to make a game where the guts are exposed and you can edit the fabric
of reality by pushing blocks around, planting flowers, flames

thinking about what a fantasy rpg that isn't driven by reward scheduling
would look like
for instance, what if you center lack of action, failure, characters
who are not powerful?
rather than worshipping player agency, i think it could be tremendous to allow
a wide variety of characters with varying amounts of agency.

game spaces are often *depleted* in the course of play so the end of a game
tends to be the point at which the possibility space is totally collapsed &
the world no longer feels alive.

Similr vein to pokemon snap: a metroid game where you play as a fragile,

The new computers can predict anything, hold maps of our entire universe in
their silicon brains: past, future, origin and end. Gamblers turn to magic,
gaze into divine realms ungoverned by logic and bet on the actions of gods

a new mockup for the player character's apartment in "panic variants".
i'm considering having it more anchored in physical reality, to ground it
more firmly as a lived in space

started Le Guin's A Legend of Earthsea and gosh I love this gentle, typical
start of a pastoral fantasy that is decidedly about women and language.

Multiplayer FPS that takes stats from every match and renders layers of dust
on surfaces where players don't walk as frequently

of the audience.
